A hero's attributes determine their native capacities, ranging from 3 to 18. Lower scores indicate deficiencies, while higher scores reflect greater development and potential.

## Generate Scores

To generate attribute scores, roll `dice: 3d6` six times and assign them in order to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.

| **Attribute** | **Effects**                                                                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength      | Power, might, physical combat prowess, load carrying capacity                              |
| Dexterity     | Agility, nimbleness, fine motor skills, quick reflexes, combat readiness                   |
| Constitution  | Resilience, endurance, resistance to toxins, ability to sustain without food or rest       |
| Intelligence  | Memory retention, logical thinking, cognitive abilities, breadth of knowledge              |
| Wisdom        | Perception, discernment, situational awareness, insight                                    |

If the scores are rolled, one attribute can be changed to **14** to represent the hero's exceptional proficiency.

> [!note] Some GMs allow players to place rolled scores in any attribute, while others maintain the original order to encourage diverse character concepts.

Alternatively, a set of predetermined scores can be used. 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7 can be used and assigned to an attribute score.

> **Strength**: 9
> **Dexterity**: 11
> **Constitution**: 14
> **Wisdom**: 7
> **Intelligence** 12
> **Charisma**: 10

## Modifiers

After generating the scores, calculate the corresponding modifiers (-1 for 5, +2 for 18) and remember to adjust them if attributes change during gameplay.

| Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|
| 3     | -2       |
| 4-7   | -1       |
| 8-13  | 0        |
| 14-17 | +1       |
| 18    | +2       |
