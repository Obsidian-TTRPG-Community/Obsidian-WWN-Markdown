## Overview

- The first step in playing this game is to create each player's character, or "PC." 
- It is recommended to play the game with a group of three to five players and a game master (GM) for the best experience.
	- However, it is possible to play this with one player and a GM.
- If you decide to play within the world of Latter Earth, refer to page 94 of the [Free Revised Edition PDF](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition?term=world+without+number). 

### What you need to know

Your character is an adventurer in the vast and captivating world crafted by your Game Master (GM). Within this world, your hero yearns for something more, a purpose that transcends the mundane. Whether it is the thrill of embarking on grand adventures, the desire to carve a legendary reputation by vanquishing a fearsome creature, or the quest for the elusive secret to eternal life, your character's aspirations are anything but ordinary.

Though your past might suggest a seemingly simple existence, there is an unmistakable spark within you that sets you apart. Deep down, you sense that this is your story, and you possess an innate drive to pursue a goal that may not yet be fully realized. The path you tread will be filled with fascinating encounters and intricate relationships, challenging you to navigate the complexities of the world around you.

And perhaps, as you delve deeper into your journey, you will come to realize that your story intertwines with the destinies of others. The web of interconnectedness reveals itself, and you begin to understand that your quest holds significance beyond your own desires. Together with those whom you've come to work with, entities who wish to see you burn, and those in between, you will find that your small choices make all the difference.
