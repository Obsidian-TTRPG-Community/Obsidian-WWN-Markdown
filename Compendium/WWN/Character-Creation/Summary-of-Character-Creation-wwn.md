> [!important] **SRD**: Non-Human Characters
> The Obsidian TTRPG Community suggests discussing the viability non-human characters before starting character creation. See [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Summary-of-Character-Creation-wwn#Step 8 - Non-Human Characters|Non-Human Characters]] for more information.

This is a quick summary of the character creation process. Grab a copy of the Character Sheet included within the [Worlds Without Number: Free Edition](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348809/Worlds-Without-Number-Free-Edition?cPath=5875_38601) and follow along.

> [!note] Picking Skills
> Some of the steps indicate you should roll or pick from the items on the [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Skills/Skill-List-wwn|Skill List]], or Page 10 of the sourcebook. The skill level increases each time it is picked:
> 
> - 1st Time: Level 0
> - 2nd Time: Level 1
> - 3rd Time: Pick another skill of choice that is less than level 1.
>
> No novice's skills can be greater than level 1.

## Step 1 - Attributes

Roll your six [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Attributes-wwn|Attributes]] by rolling `dice: 3d6` six times. You may assign them in an array using the numbers 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 7 in any configuration you wish. The attributes are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

![[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Attributes-wwn#^WWN-Attributes-Roll-Table|Attributes-wwn]]


> [!hint] If you roll your scores, you may pick 1 to change to a score of 14.


## Step 2 - Attribute Modifiers

Determine your **attribute modifiers** for each score. 

![[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Attributes-wwn#^WWN-attribute-modifiers|Attributes-wwn]]

## Step 3 - Backgrounds

Choose a **[[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Backgrounds/Backgrounds|Background]]** from the list on page 11. Include any particular details you assign for it. You also gain a skill listed under the background name at level-0.

## Step 4 - Additional Skills

When selecting skills for your character, you have two choices: roll for additional skills or pick them. If you choose to pick skills, you can select two from the Learning table for your character's background, excluding "Any Skill" options and skills from the Growth table. 

Alternatively, you can simply choose the default "Quick Skills" listed for your character's background at level-0.

## Step 5 - Skill Rolls

If you decide to roll for your skills, you have the option to roll up to three times. You can allocate your rolls between the Growth and Learning tables as desired. 

When rolling on the Growth table, some results may provide a "+2 Physical" or "+2 Mental" bonus. 
- The "+2 Physical" bonus allows you to add two points to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, or one point to two different stats. 
- The "+2 Mental" bonus allows you to add two points to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, or split the bonus between two of those stats.

## Step 6 - Class

When selecting your **[[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Class/Class|Class]]**, refer to the options provided on page 18. Choose a class that aligns with the talents most relevant to an adventurer's lifestyle. 

If none of the classes (Warrior, Expert, or Mage) adequately describe your hero, you have the flexibility to choose Adventurer and combine aspects from multiple classes.

## Step 7 - Foci

When selecting your **[[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Foci/Foci|Foci]]**, you are choosing the what makes your hero great. 
- You can select one level of a Focus of your choice. 
- If your character has the Expert class or the Partial Expert feature of the Adventurer class, they receive one level of a non-combat Focus for free in addition to their choice. 
	- They can allocate both levels to the same Focus, starting with level 2 if desired. 
- Similarly, characters with the Warrior class or the Partial Warrior feature of the Adventurer class can choose one level of a combat-related Focus and allocate both levels to the same Focus if they wish.

## Step 8 - Non-Human Characters
*This is an optional step that may not apply to all characters.*

If your Game Master (GM) permits non-human player characters (PCs), you have the option to choose a non-human creature by using a Focus pick on the appropriate origin Focus. The details and descriptions of non-human options can be found in the bestiary chapter starting on page 280. 

> [!note] It's important to note that not all campaigns allow non-human PCs, as it depends on the specific setting and tone chosen by your GM.

## Step 9 - Interests

**Choose a skill** that represents your character's interests, motivations, hobbies, etc. 


## Step 10 - Traditions
*This is an optional step that may not apply to all characters.*

If you have selected the Mage class or opted to be an Adventurer with the Partial Mage class, you must choose a tradition to follow. The available traditions, such as High Mage, Necromancer, Elementalist, Healer, or Vowed, can be found in the [[Compendium/WWN/Magic/Magic|Magic]] chapter starting on page 60. 

You can be a full-fledged practitioner of a specific tradition or have a partial class or expertise in certain magical disciplines, depending on your chosen path as an Adventurer.


## Step 11 - Spells
*This is an optional step that may not apply to all characters.*

If you are a full High Mage, Elementalist, or Necromancer, or have chosen to be a Partial Mage in two of these classes, you need to select your starting spells from your class's first-level spell list. 
- Full mages can choose four spells.
- Partial Mages can choose two spells. 

## Step 12 - Hit Points

To determine your maximum **hit points**, roll the designated die based on your chosen class and add your Constitution modifier. The minimum hit point value is 1. The hit point dice for each class are as follows: 
- Warriors roll 1d6+2
- Experts roll 1d6
- Mages roll 1d6-1. 
- Adventurers refer to the tables on page 21, depending on the partial classes they have taken. 

If your character loses all their hit points, they will either be mortally wounded or killed outright.

## Step 13 - Base Attack Bonus

Refer to the class tables on page 18 to determine your hero's **base attack bonus**, which represents their martial aptitude. This value varies based on your character's class.

## Step 14 - Equipment

You have two options for acquiring starting **equipment**.
- You can choose one of the equipment packages listed on page 29.
- You can roll `dice: 3d6` and multiply the result by 10 ( `dice: 3d6*10` ) to determine the amount of starting silver pieces you have to spend on gear.

## Step 15 - Hit Bonus

To calculate your total hit bonus with weaponry, add your base attack bonus, the appropriate skill (Punch, Stab, or Shoot) based on the weapon type, and the relevant attribute modifier. 

Refer to the weapon table on page 37 to determine which attribute is used for a specific weapon. 

If two attributes are listed, choose only one. 

If you *do not have any* combat skills even at level-0, apply a -2 penalty to your hit roll.

## Step 16 - Weapon Damage

When noting down the damage done by your weapons, calculate it by adding the base damage dice of the weapon to its attribute modifier. 

If the weapon is a Punch weapon, you can also include your Punch skill bonus in the damage calculation.

## Step 17 - Armor Class

Record your **Armor Class** (AC), which represents the difficulty of inflicting damage on your hero during combat. Consult the armor table on page 35 to determine the AC provided by the specific armor you are wearing. 

If you are not wearing any armor, your base AC is 10. Additionally, add your Dexterity modifier to your AC. 

To successfully harm your character, an enemy must roll an attack roll on a d20, add their attack bonus, and meet or exceed your AC value.

## Step 18 - Saving Throws

Take note of your starting **saving throw** scores for Physical, Evasion, Mental, and Luck.

- Physical saves, which protect against poison, disease, or exhaustion, are calculated as 15 minus the higher of your Strength or Constitution modifiers.
- Evasion saves, used to avoid sudden perils or evade explosives, are calculated as 15 minus the higher of your Intelligence and Dexterity modifiers.
- Mental saves, which help resist psychic influence or mind-bending sorceries, are calculated as 15 minus the higher of your Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.
- Luck saves have a flat score of 15 and are used when chance alone determines your ability to avoid a random disaster.

To successfully make a save, you need to roll equal to or higher than the saving throw score on a d20 roll.

## Step 19 - You

Complete your character by giving them a name and a goal. Every hero needs a goal when embarking on an adventure. While the goal may evolve, your character should **always** have a motivation to explore and interact with the world. 

It's important to avoid creating stay-at-home characters, aloof loners, overly cautious heroes, or those unwilling to take daring risks for their objectives, as they tend to be less enjoyable to play, and play with!
