To complete the creation of your hero, there are a few final steps to take. These steps involve determining starting hit points, selecting a free skill, and making some additional record-keeping choices to streamline gameplay.

## Starting Hit Points

To determine your initial maximum hit points, roll the appropriate die based on your class:

- **Warriors**: Roll 1d6 and add 2 to the result.
- **Experts**: Roll 1d6.
- **Mages**: Roll 1d6 and subtract 1 from the result.
- **Adventurers**: Refer to the tables on page 21, depending on the partial classes chosen.

After rolling the die, add your Constitution modifier to the result to calculate your initial maximum HP. It is important to note that even if you have a Constitution penalty, the minimum hit points you can have is 1 point.

Remember, your hit points represent your character's health and determine how much damage they can withstand before being mortally wounded or killed outright.

## Free Skill

A skill that reflects your hero's past interests, talents, or professional work. This skill will be gained at level-0 proficiency, allowing you to showcase some expertise in this particular area.

If you already have this skill at level-0, it will automatically advance to level-1, representing your continued growth and experience in that skill. However, please note that this free pick cannot be used to further improve a skill that is already at level-1.

> [!summary] Free Skills
> Consider your character's background, story and personality to determine the most suitable skill that aligns with their past interests or expertise. Did your magical character want to compensate for any weaknesses and chose something that increases their physical prowess? Did you warrior who was village was illiterate, prioritise the reading and writing arts, or did they become proficient at book burning?

## The Saving Throws

To determine your beginning saving throw scores, follow the guidelines below:

1. Physical Save: This save is used to resist effects such as poison, disease or exhaustion. Calculate it as 15 minus the highest modifier between your Strength and Constitution. For example, if your Strength modifier is +2 and your Constitution modifier is +3, your Physical save would be 15–3 = 12.

2. Evasion Save: This save is employed to dodge sudden perils or evade explosive situations. Determine it as 15 minus the highest modifier between your Intelligence and Dexterity. For instance, if your Intelligence modifier is +1 and your Dexterity modifier is +4, your Evasion save would be 15–4 = 11.

3. Mental Save: This save is utilised to resist psychic influence or mind-bending sorceries. Calculate it as 15 minus the highest modifier between your Wisdom and Charisma. For example, if your Wisdom modifier is +3 and your Charisma modifier is +2, your Mental save would be 15–3 = 12.

4. Luck Save: This save has a flat score of 15 and is rolled against when blind luck becomes your only saviour. Unlike the other saving throws, the Luck save does not depend on any ability modifiers and remains constant.

## Base Attack Bonus

As part of your character sheet, it is important to note down your hero's base attack bonus (BAB), which represents their inherent combat competence. The specific value of the BAB depends on your character's class, and it is listed on the class tables.

Refer to the class description and table for your chosen class to determine your character's BAB. Write this value on your character sheet, as it will be used to calculate your attack bonus when engaging in combat.

## Starting Spells for Mages

As a spellcasting full Mage, you will begin play with knowledge of four first-level spells. These spells can be chosen from any spell list available to you. For example, a novice High Mage would select their spells from the High Magic spell list, while an aspiring Elementalist could choose spells from either the High Magic or Elementalist spell lists.

If you are a partial Mage, your starting spell repertoire consists of two first-level spells. Similarly, Adventurers who have chosen two partial Mage classes, such as a partial Necromancer/partial High Mage, will begin play knowing four first-level spells. In all cases, you can select your spells from any applicable spell list based on your chosen Mage classes.

Take some time to consider your character's magical inclination, thematic preferences, and playstyle when choosing your starting spells. These spells will form the foundation of your magical abilities and play a crucial role in shaping your character's capabilities in the world.

## Starting Languages

At the beginning of the game, characters have knowledge of their native language and Trade Cant. In addition, their fluency in additional languages is based on their Connect and Know skill levels.

Having a level-0 proficiency in either Connect or Know grants knowledge of one additional language. If a character has a level-1 proficiency in Connect or Know, they gain fluency in two additional languages. For example, a character with Connect-1 and Know-1 skills would start with fluency in their native language, Trade Cant, and four additional languages of their choice.

As characters progress and increase their Connect or Know skills, they can learn one more language for each level they gain. Additionally, by immersing themselves in a particular culture for a few months, characters can also learn new languages.

For a list of common languages in the Gyre region of the Latter Earth, please refer to page 107 of the rulebook. This list can provide inspiration and guidance for selecting additional languages for your character's linguistic repertoire.

## Starting Equipment

During character creation, you have the option to choose a starting equipment package from the choices provided on the opposite page of the rulebook. These packages are pre-determined sets of gear that offer a well-rounded assortment of items to begin your adventuring journey. Keep in mind that the starting packages generally provide more equipment than the random roll option.

Alternatively, you can roll 3d6 and multiply the result by 10 to determine the number of starting silver pieces you have available to spend on gear or keep in your pocket. This random roll provides flexibility in selecting individual items based on your preferences and needs.

`dice: 3d6*10`

While the starting packages offer a convenient selection of equipment, the GM may allow you to make swaps or adjustments to better suit your character concept. Discuss with your GM if you wish to modify the starting package to better align with your character's playstyle or narrative.

## Weapons and Armor

To record the total hit bonus for your weaponry, follow these steps:

1. Determine your base attack bonus (BAB) based on your class and level. This value represents your character's combat competence.

2. Add your relevant Stab, Shoot or Punch skill level to the BAB. This reflects your proficiency and training in using that specific type of weapon.

3. Determine the relevant attribute modifier for the weapon based on the table on page 37. Use the better of the two listed attributes if applicable.

4. Add the attribute modifier to the total hit bonus calculation. This accounts for your character's natural ability and aptitude with the weapon.
    

If you lack even level-0 skill in the weapon, take a -2 hit penalty when using it. This penalty reflects your unfamiliarity and lack of training in utilizing that specific weapon.

Record the damage and Shock information for each weapon, as noted in the table. Add your attribute modifier to both the damage rolls and Shock values. For Punch weapons or unarmed attacks, you can also add your Punch skill.

Next, note down the Armor Class (AC) of the armor you usually wear. If you are unarmored, the AC is 10 for humans. The AC can be modified by your Dexterity modifier, improving it with a bonus or worsening it with a penalty. Consider your character's agility and nimbleness when determining the AC modification based on your Dexterity modifier.

## Who are You?

Finally, bestow a fitting name upon your newly-created hero. Additionally, give them a compelling goal in life, and a why their willingness to embark on adventures alongside their fellow PCs. It is crucial for each player character to have an active objective, something they are willing to risk their lives for. While goals may evolve over the course of the game, it is important to ensure they do not interfere with the enjoyment of the rest of the group.

Furthermore, establish a why for your character to trust and collaborate with their comrades. While personal affections may not be present, there should be enough faith in each other to undertake daring adventures together.

> [!example]- Adara Stormrider
> **Name**: Adara Stormrider
> **Goal**: To uncover the truth behind her family's mysterious disappearance and bring those responsible to justice.
> **Reason for Adventuring**: Adara believes that by venturing into the world and undertaking perilous quests, she will uncover clues and secrets that will lead her closer to the truth about her family's fate. She is driven by a deep sense of duty, and the desire to bring closure to her own personal tragedy. Alongside the other PCs, Adara sees an opportunity to find allies who share her desire for justice and have the skills and resources to aid her in her quest. While she may not necessarily trust them completely at first, Adara recognises the value in working together towards a common goal and believes that by pooling their strengths, they stand a better chance of overcoming the challenges that lie ahead. Through shared experiences, and the bonds formed during their adventures, she hopes to build a strong foundation of trust and camaraderie among the group.
