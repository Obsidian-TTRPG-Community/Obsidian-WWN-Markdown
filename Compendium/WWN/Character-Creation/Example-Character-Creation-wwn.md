Jack creates a new hero for the campaign, starting with rolling 3d6 for each attribute. The results are as follows: Strength 9, Dexterity 6, Constitution 10, Intelligence 12, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 9. Jack notices that his hero is average in most attributes, but a bit slower and clumsier due to the -1 Dexterity modifier. He has the option to swap one attribute score with a score of 14, giving it a +1 modifier, but Jack decides to make that decision later.

Moving on, Jack rolls randomly to determine his hero's background, and the dice determine that he was a Peasant. Finding it amusing, Jack continues with the random theme and rolls for skills. The Peasant background grants him the Exert-0 skill for free, and he can roll three more times on either the Growth or Learning tables. Jack chooses to roll once on the Growth table and twice on the Learning table, resulting in "Any Skill," "Sneak," and "Work" skills. Jack interprets these skills to represent the hero's farming, husbandry, poaching, and stealth abilities, giving him skills of Exert-0, Work-0, Sneak-0, and Shoot-0.

Considering his hero's attributes, Jack decides to improve Dexterity by using the free 14 score, changing its modifier from -1 to +1. This makes his hero a better archer and stealthier. Next, Jack needs to choose a class for his hero. While he considers the Mage and Warrior classes, he ultimately decides that Expert is the best fit, focusing on his hero's sneaking and woodsman skills. Instead of opting for the Adventurer class, Jack believes that a pure Expert will provide the desired versatility in skill use.

Moving on to Foci selection, Jack chooses two Foci for his hero: Alert and Spirit Familiar. The Alert Focus grants his hero the Notice skill as a bonus, while the Spirit Familiar adds an element of the uncanny to the poacher, manifesting as a loyal hunting dog's spirit with intuitive knowledge. Jack adds the skills Shoot-0, Exert-0, Notice-0, Sneak-0, Work-0 to his hero's sheet. He then selects Survive-0 as a free pick to reflect his hero's experience in enduring hardships.

With the skills and Foci chosen, Jack rolls 1d6 for his hero's initial maximum hit points, obtaining a result of 4. Recognising the hero's vulnerability, Jack decides to avoid combat whenever possible. He selects the "Ranger or Archer" equipment package for his hero's gear.

Finally, Jack gives his hero a name, Ulf, and a background tie to the rest of the group. Ulf hails from Llaigis, a grim land with oppressive lords and harsh living conditions. He ran away from his lord when taxes led to his loyal hunting dog's starvation. Ulf's goal is to amass wealth and power to seek revenge against his former master. When Ulf met the party during a hunt, his dog, Limper, took a liking to them, and Ulf trusts the dog's judgment implicitly. The GM notes these goals as potential adventure hooks.

With Ulf's creation complete, he is now ready to embark on his adventuring journey.
