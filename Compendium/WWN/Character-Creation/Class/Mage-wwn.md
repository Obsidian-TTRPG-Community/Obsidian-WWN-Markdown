Mages harness arcane powers and mystical arts to pursue their ambitions. They can be trained in formal sorcerous schools, receive guidance from wise mentors, or even awaken to their powers spontaneously.

Each Mage belongs to a specific magical tradition that defines their abilities and limitations.

> [!tip] Consult the GM
> Consult with your GM to determine which traditions exist in the campaign you will be playing.

While traditional spellcasting is common, some traditions focus on physical prowess or unique arcane gifts. Mages dedicate much of their time to study and training, leaving little room for other skills. They are typically weaker in combat compared to Warriors and face specific limitations based on their chosen tradition.

For example, some may be unable to wear armor while casting spells. Additionally, certain traditions may result in social stigma or difficulties in dealing with society. Mages possess impressive magical abilities, but they come at a price and require careful navigation of their unique challenges and restrictions.

The practice of magic is often tailored to specific campaign settings and can be subject to restrictions or exclusions by the GM. In some settings, such as historical periods or low-magic worlds, Mages may not exist at all, leaving heroes to rely solely on their physical abilities and wit. Mage heroes require strategic planning and cooperation within their party to maximize their abilities.

While their spells can be powerful, Mages have limited options and their effects are often specific. They may not match the combat prowess of Warriors or the versatility of Experts in certain tasks. Instead, Mages excel at providing strategic solutions and defying reality to accomplish remarkable feats that aid their allies in overcoming formidable challenges.
