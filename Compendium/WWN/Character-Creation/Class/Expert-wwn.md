The Expert class is ideal for heroes who excel in specific skills such as thievery, diplomacy, healing, scholarship, exploration and craftsmanship. Experts possess a wide range of non-combat skills and have a remarkable ability to quickly develop new ones. They have a unique talent for using their skills effectively at critical moments, even if it's not their primary area of expertise.

Once per scene, an Expert can reroll a failed non-combat skill check, granting them a second opportunity to turn potential failure into success. With their focus on skill development, Experts are also well-versed combatants who can hold their own in dangerous battles. Some Experts even specialise in martial professions, leveraging their exceptional stealth and deception abilities as assassins.
