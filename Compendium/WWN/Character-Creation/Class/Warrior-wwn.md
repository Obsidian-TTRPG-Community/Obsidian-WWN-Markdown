## Class Ability–Killing Blow

A Warrior's attacks, spells, and special abilities are enhanced by adding half their character level, rounded up, to the damage inflicted. This bonus damage also applies to any Shock caused. When combined with Foci that improve Shock attacks, such as **Armsmaster**, **Close Combatant**, or **Shocking Assault**, this ability ensures that a seasoned Warrior can easily dispatch ordinary human soldiers or minor monsters, regardless of their attack roll result.

## Class Ability–Veteran's Luck

The Warrior possesses the ability to alter the outcome of attacks once per scene. They can turn a missed attack they made into a hit or convert a successful attack against them into a miss, both as Instant actions. This power is especially deadly when combined with the *Snap Attack* action against weaker opponents or ordinary human warriors.
- The Warrior can only use this ability once in a scene and must choose between forcing a miss or ensuring a hit on a foe.
- It is also applicable when helping with crew-served weapons but cannot negate environmental or vehicle/mount damage.
