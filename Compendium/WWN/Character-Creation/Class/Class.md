## Choosing a Class

A hero's background is a reflection of upbringing and circumstance, but a **class** is how your hero succeeds. Most individuals lack a class, but your PC is a diamond in the rough who has the potential to be something great.

There are four classes available, each with their own individual skillsets and playstyles.

Each class page includes the class's attack bonus, focus, and hit dice.

> [!hint] You are a hero, and heroes come from everywhere
> When choosing a class, do not feel like you must choose one that fits your background. A thug can be a mage, a noble can be an expert, and a courtesan can be a warrior. Choose the class the fits the combat style your hero excels in.

### Experts

Experts possess exceptional proficiency in non-combat skills, including stealth, medicine, diplomacy, and various practical talents. While all heroes can develop these skills to some degree, Experts excel at learning them swiftly and applying them with remarkable effectiveness. Their mastery allows them to succeed in challenging situations where other heroes might falter or fall short.

### Mages

Mages encompass a diverse range of heroes, including traditional wizards, magical healers, skilled unarmed fighters, and wise sages with supernatural insight. Each Mage is affiliated with a particular magical tradition that shapes their abilities and imposes specific taboos they must adhere to. While Mages possess formidable powers, they generally exhibit a more delicate constitution and may be less proficient in combat compared to other heroes.

### Warriors

Warriors are skilled fighters who employ swords, bows, or their own fists to confront and conquer adversaries, ensuring their own survival in the midst of violence. Combat is a perilous endeavor in this world, where death lurks around every corner for all heroes. However, Warriors possess the necessary abilities to endure errors that would prove fatal to others and triumph over opponents who would overpower less martial individuals.

### Adventurers

Adventurers are a versatile class suited for players who find it difficult to settle on a single class or have a character concept that blends multiple class elements. By selecting two other classes, Adventurers can combine their features, gaining partial proficiency in both disciplines. However, this versatility comes at the cost of not reaching the same level of expertise as dedicated practitioners of other fields.
