Not all heroes fit neatly into one of the three main classes. For those who possess a mix of talents and abilities, the class of Adventurer may be a great fit. An Adventurer selects two of the three main classes to represent their unique skills and capabilities.

For example:
- A character skilled in both spellcasting and swordplay might choose to be a Partial Mage/Partial Warrior.
- A stealthy assassin could be a Partial Expert/Partial Warrior.
- A cunning trickster with magical prowess might be a Partial Expert/Partial Mage.

The player should choose the combination that best suits their character concept.

The tables provided in the adjacent section outline the hit dice, attack bonus, and Foci picks gained by each possible pairing. For instance:
- A first-level Partial Expert/Partial Warrior would roll 1d6+2 for hit points, have a +1 attack bonus, and choose three Foci: one from the Expert class, one from the Warrior class, and one free pick.

Adventurers have a broader range of abilities compared to more specialised characters, and the extra Focus pick can make a significant difference at lower levels. However, the absence of the strongest class abilities of Experts and Warriors does impact their long-term progression. It's important to note that a Partial Mage will not achieve the same level of magical power in their chosen tradition as a dedicated specialist in that class.

## Partial Expert Partial Warrior

A Partial Expert functions similarly to a full Expert, enjoying the same benefits such as the **Quick Learner** ability.

However, they do not possess the **Masterful Expertise** ability, as they lack the wide-ranging versatility of a complete Expert.

## Partial Expert Partial Mage

A Partial Mage is treated as a Mage and gains access to the **Arcane Tradition** ability, allowing them to select a magical tradition for their powers. However, the abilities associated with the chosen tradition are somewhat limited for Partial Mages, as outlined in the specific descriptions for each path.

![[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Class/Mage-wwn#Class Ability – Arcane Tradition|Mage-wwn]]


It is even possible for a character to choose the Partial Mage class twice, opting for two different magical traditions and gaining partial access to the powers of both. The character would then follow the standard Mage chart for hit dice, attack bonus, and Foci, as well as the spellcasting table on page 64 if both partial classes have spellcasting abilities.

Regardless of any other partial class they may have, a Partial Mage must adhere to the restrictions and limitations of their chosen magical tradition to utilise its unique abilities.

| ----- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1     | 1d6      | +0           | 1 Expert + 1 Any               |
| 2     | 2d6      | +1           | +1 Any                         |

## Partial Mage Partial Warrior

A Partial Warrior possesses some advantages of a full Warrior, such as an improved hit die, and a slightly enhanced attack bonus. However, they do not possess the special ability of **Veteran's Luck** or the power of **Killing Blow**. Instead, they rely on their own skills and abilities to land strikes and defeat their adversaries.
