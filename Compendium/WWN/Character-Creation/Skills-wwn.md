Skills represent your hero's proficiencies and abilities in various areas. They determine how skilled and knowledgeable your hero is in a particular field. Every hero can attempt tasks even without the corresponding skill, but having the right skill significantly increases the chances of success.

Skills are ranked from level-0 to level-4. Level-0 represents ordinary proficiency, while level-4 represents exceptional mastery. As a novice adventurer, your hero will start with skills at level-0 or level-1, depending on your chosen or rolled background, which will be explained in the following section. Some specialised challenges may require specific skills to attempt, and without the appropriate skill, certain tasks may be impossible to undertake, such as advanced mathematics or magic theory.

| Level | Description                                             |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | An ordinary competence at the skill                     |
| 1     | A veteran professional, noticeably better than most     |
| 2     | One of the best in the city, a talented master          |
| 3     | One of the best in the kingdom, an inspirational master |
| 4     | One of the best in the world, pushing skill limits      |

## Skill Checks

When your hero attempts a task that requires exceptional expertise, a skill check is required. To make a skill check, you roll 2d6 and add the relevant skill level and the modifier of the most pertinent attribute score. If you don't have the relevant skill, you subtract 1 from your roll. If the total meets or exceeds the difficulty of the check, the attempt is successful. If the total is lower, you may fail, succeed in a way that doesn't provide significant benefit, or face an unfortunate turn of events that spoils your effort.

The attribute used in a skill check depends on the specific situation. For example, lifting a heavy rock might involve a Strength/Exert skill check, while running a marathon could be a Constitution/Exert check. If there is ambiguity about which attribute to use or if multiple skills could apply to a check, the GM makes the decision.

Certain skills require at least level-0 proficiency to attempt, particularly if they involve specialised or obscure undertakings. While any hero can attempt common tasks related to their background without a skill check, skill checks are reserved for exceptional or unusual challenges.

In summary, skill checks are used for exceptional tasks that go beyond the ordinary, and the outcome is determined by the roll, skill level, and attribute modifiers involved.

## Skill List

### Administer

Administer involves overseeing and managing various aspects of an organization to ensure its smooth functioning. This includes tasks such as maintaining efficient operations, documenting information accurately, coordinating logistics, identifying incompetent or deceitful employees, analyzing records or archives, and fulfilling responsibilities typically associated with executives or middle-managers.

### Connect

Connect entails the ability to establish and maintain valuable relationships with individuals who can be beneficial for your objectives. This involves cultivating friendships or social acquaintances, knowing who to approach for favors or services, and leveraging the resources and support of affiliated organizations. The Connect aspect also encompasses your computer's capacity to locate the people you require, although persuading them to assist you may require additional efforts.

### Convince

Convince refers to the ability to persuade someone that a statement or proposition you present is true. The level of difficulty in persuading individuals depends on factors such as the plausibility of your claim and the extent to which it conflicts with their emotional values. It is important to note that the actions individuals take based on their newly formed convictions are influenced by their own motivations and may not be entirely predictable.

### Convince

Convince involves the art of persuading a listener to believe the truth of what you are saying.

It's important to note that individuals' actions based on their newfound conviction are influenced by their own motivations and may not always be completely predictable.

### Craft

Craft encompasses the ability to create or repair various goods and technologies that are appropriate to your character's background and society. The Craft skill can be applied to a wide range of artisan pursuits, although the Game Master has the authority to restrict the construction of complex items that deviate too far from your character's past experiences and expertise.

### Exert

Exert involves using your physical strength, stamina, and coordination to engage in activities such as running, swimming, climbing, jumping, laboring for extended periods, or throwing objects. Even characters with below-average physical attributes can possess a proficient Exert skill, reflecting athletic training and the ability to optimize their available talents.

### Lead

Lead entails the ability to inspire others to follow your guidance and believe in your plans and goals. It involves managing and motivating subordinates to remain focused, loyal, and motivated even in the face of danger or failure. A successful leader can maintain their subordinates' faith and confidence, even when rationality might cast doubt on the leader's plans.

###   Notice

Notice involves the ability to observe small details, anticipate potential ambushes, identify hidden features or concealed objects, and detect subtle sensory input such as smells or sounds. While it cannot be used solely to detect lies, keen attention can often discern a subject's emotional state.

### Perform

It also includes the ability to compose music, plays, writings, or other forms of performance art. Most performers excel in a particular field, although polymaths with versatile backgrounds can exist.

It also aids in recognizing religious iconography and influential individuals within religious hierarchies. Additionally, the Pray skill provides insight into the state of local faiths.
