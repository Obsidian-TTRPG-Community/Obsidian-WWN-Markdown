title: Equipment Packages
---

To determine your hero's starting equipment, you have two options. First, you can choose a suitable package from the selections provided below. Alternatively, you can roll `dice: 3d6*10|form` to determine the starting silver for your character and purchase individual items from the equipment section starting on page 33.

It's generally recommended to select a package for simplicity, but feel free to discuss any item swaps with the GM if needed. By default, PCs have ordinary clothing and personal effects that do not count towards their Encumbrance. However, if you carry a spare set of clothing in a backpack, it will contribute to your Encumbrance.

Please keep in mind that armour needs to be worn ready to provide any benefit, while stowed weapons require an extra Main Action to be readied for use. Backpacks and other storage gear are typically considered stowed unless you want to tie them loosely for quick access or in case you need to drop them to flee a situation.

Choose your starting equipment package or roll for silver and begin equipping your hero accordingly.
