You come from a background considered savage even in this harsh world. Whether you belong to primitive hill tribes, resilient jungle clans, or isolated frontiersmen, you have learned to survive without the comforts of a more civilized society. Your acceptance of violence is ingrained, enabling you to stay alive in perilous situations. However, your rugged upbringing does not imply ignorance or inflexibility, nor does it negate the existence of your own unique cultural practices.
