Transporting goods overland is a challenging and perilous task that demands individuals of exceptional fortitude. Carters are the backbone of this endeavor, whether they are part of a caravan traversing vast distances with valuable cargo, independent drivers shuttling goods between remote villages, or brave messengers risking their lives to deliver small packages. Despite their humble origins, carters often gain a broader perspective of the world than the aristocracy of their homeland. Through their extensive travels, these seasoned haulers become adept at navigating treacherous situations and swiftly adapting to adversity.
