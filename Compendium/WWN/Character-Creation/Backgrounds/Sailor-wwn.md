Your hero was a sailor, navigating the vast seas or mighty rivers of their homeland. They may have held the esteemed position of ship captain, worked as a bargeman on expansive waterways, or been a humble seaman willing to join any vessel that welcomed them. In certain regions, there may even be unconventional ships such as aircraft or other peculiar crafts requiring a skilled crew. Sailors are well-acquainted with the unpredictable dangers and demanding tasks that come with their maritime lives. The self-reliance fostered by a life at sea often proves advantageous to an adventurer.
