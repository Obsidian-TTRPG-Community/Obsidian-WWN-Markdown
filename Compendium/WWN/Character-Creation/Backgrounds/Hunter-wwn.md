Both tribes and nobles rely on hunting for sustenance and entertainment, often hiring skilled hunters to assist them. Some hunters are driven by hunger or greed, venturing into game preserves or perilous wilderness in search of prey. Some work as gamekeepers, protecting against poachers, while others prefer a solitary existence as hermits. The sharpshooting and stealth abilities of a seasoned hunter are valuable assets in the life of an adventurer.
