Your hero's profession was that of a warrior, earning a living through their involvement in war. Whether as a mercenary, a regular soldier, a knight affiliated with a temple, a defender within a monastic order, a militiaman in a village, or a raider from a savage background, your hero's life was intertwined with combat. However, you may have grown weary of the constant violence, lost your previous employer, or simply found the rewards for your efforts to be insufficient. As a result, you have chosen to embark on an adventurous path. With your diverse skills and experiences, every group recognises the value of an adaptable and skilled warrior.
