Your hero is one of the unfortunate individuals who have no home to call their own. Perhaps you were forced into exile due to hostile neighbors, a sudden change in political circumstances, or a crime that may or may not have been committed. Your former home might have been ravaged by enemies or altered by significant events to the point where you no longer belonged. Now you embark on a journey driven by your own motivations, searching for whatever it is you hope to find in this world. Adventurers often possess a unique tolerance for vagabonds like yourself, a quality not commonly found in more settled societies.
