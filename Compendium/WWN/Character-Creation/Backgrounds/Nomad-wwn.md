Certain cultures rely on extensive travel to sustain themselves, whether as beast-riders, wagon drivers, or nomadic groups moving from one waystation to another. These people are compelled to roam due to limited resources in their native lands or the need to constantly evade threats. Settled communities often view nomads with suspicion, fearing their potential for mischief before they disappear beyond reach. However, the nomads' expertise in riding and surviving harsh environments makes them valuable assets to any adventurer.
