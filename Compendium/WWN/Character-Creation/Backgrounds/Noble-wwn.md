Nobility takes different forms in different cultures, whether based on personal virtue, bloodlines, or specific roles within society. Your hero belonged to the noble class of their homeland, one of the privileged elites who held positions of power and authority. However, unfortunate circumstances have led you to leave behind your former life and seek adventure, forging your own path in the world. While you may have lost the privileges and status of your noble rank, you still possess the knowledge and education that came with it.
