Merchants come in various forms, from wealthy merchant-princes in bustling trading cities to humble peddlers traveling between villages, selling everyday items like sewing needles and tin pans. Engaging in trade is a perilous endeavor in this world, facing the constant threats of demanding lords and ruthless bandits. Only the courageous and bold venture into this profession. Some merchants, driven by ambition and a desire for wealth, even become adventurers to gain capital and valuable connections for their trade.
