Your hero had a background as a skilled crafter, such as a blacksmith, carpenter, shipwright, weaver, or creator of unique goods. In rural areas, artisans often supplemented their income with subsistence farming, while in urban areas they were likely full-time professionals and members of specialized guilds. While their expertise lies in their specific craft, artisans often possess enough knowledge and adaptability to make competent attempts at other types of work.
