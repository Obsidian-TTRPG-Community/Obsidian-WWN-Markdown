Peasants endure a challenging existence, with varying degrees of hardship depending on the region they inhabit. Even in prosperous lands, their lives are marked by hunger, poverty, and the constant struggle to meet their basic needs. They are accustomed to a world where personal effort is necessary for survival, relying on what they can grow, create, scavenge, or acquire through less honorable means. Their resourcefulness, endurance, and ability to endure hardship make them valuable assets to any adventurer. As such, the loss of a few peasants in perilous situations is often dismissed by their ruling lords.
