Slavery in this world encompasses a wide range of experiences, from the privileged existence of favored house slaves to the harsh and grueling conditions of mines and factories. It is not uncommon for a slave to endure both extremes as circumstances change or their appeal diminishes. In certain regions, former slaves may have the opportunity to regain honor and social standing, while in others, they face a bleak existence without even basic necessities. Among the ranks of adventurers, one can find a significant presence of runaways, rebels, and ex-slaves, all driven by desperation and a desire for freedom.
