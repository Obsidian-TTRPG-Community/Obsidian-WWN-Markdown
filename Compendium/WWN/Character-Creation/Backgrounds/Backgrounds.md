## Overview

Choose or roll from the background table to determine your hero's previous life before becoming an adventurer, and customize the details within reason. 

Discuss with your GM for coherence with the campaign setting. 

If your desired background isn't listed, work with the GM to create suitable options.

### Backgrounds and Skills

After selecting your background, you receive a free level-0 skill associated with it. Then, choose one of the following:

1. Pick the background's quick skills.
2. Choose two skills from the background's Learning table (excluding "Any Skill").
3. Roll three times, allocating the rolls between the Growth and Learning tables. This grants an extra skill or a chance to improve attributes.

For combat skills, "Any Combat" lets you choose Stab, Shoot, or Punch. "Any Skill" allows you to select any desired skill. Skills can be improved if chosen or rolled multiple times.

### Gaining Skills and Attributes

Skills start at level-0 and can be improved to level-1 by rolling or selecting them again. 

Novice heroes cannot have skills higher than level-1. 

Attribute bonuses from rolling on the Growth table can be used to raise attributes, up to a maximum of 18, with a +2 bonus split between two attributes.
