Your hero served as a healer, providing vital medical assistance to those in need. In urban settings, they may have been a formally educated practitioner skilled in complex healing techniques involving horoscopes, gemstones, and the medicinal properties of precious metals. In rural areas, they might have relied on knowledge of herbal remedies, basic suturing, and splinting. Adventuring groups greatly value the presence of a trained healer, regardless of their specific background, recognising the importance of someone capable of tending to wounds, alleviating ailments, and offering essential medical care to their companions.
