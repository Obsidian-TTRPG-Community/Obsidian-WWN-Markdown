This background encompasses performers and artists such as singers, dancers, musicians, actors, poets, and storytellers. In this harsh world, only a select few can earn a decent living from their art, and their success often relies on their ability to charm and captivate wealthy patrons. Even a traveling bard who relies on the goodwill of tavern keepers and common folk must possess the skill of winning people over. This talent for managing relationships and influencing others can prove valuable for an adventurer.
