In rural areas and villages, the majority of people are humble peasants. In cities, however, unskilled laborers make up the working class, performing day-to-day tasks for artisans and craftsmen. Their lives are difficult and uncertain, offering little promise for the future. Yet, the allure of city life and the potential for wealth and status tempt many impoverished individuals from the countryside. When luck and apprenticeship opportunities are lacking, some laborers choose the path of adventure, risking their lives in search of a better fate than enduring lifelong poverty.
