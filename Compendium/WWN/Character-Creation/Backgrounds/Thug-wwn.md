title: Thug
---

Unlike a soldier who is part of a structured organisation, your character was more of a thug. As a village bully, street ruffian, assassin, bandit, outlaw, or neighbourhood enforcer, you relied on your physical strength to get what you wanted. However, not all thugs are simple criminals. Perhaps you acted as a protector for your family or gang, or defended your neighbourhood against external threats or oppressive rulers. Regardless, circumstances or aspirations have led you to embrace the life of an adventurer. Your unique blend of raw violence and calculated social skills is likely to prove valuable in your new trade.
