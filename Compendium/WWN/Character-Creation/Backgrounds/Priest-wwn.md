Priests in this world encompass a wide range of roles and practices. Some serve as moral guides, teaching their followers about the ethical principles of their religion and nurturing their faith. Others focus primarily on performing rituals to appease and invoke their deities, prioritizing correct execution and timely compensation. Adventuring priests often lean towards the latter approach, offering support to their companions through prayers and adept interpersonal skills. Some priests possess magical abilities granted by their divine patrons or acquired through rigorous training during their youth.
