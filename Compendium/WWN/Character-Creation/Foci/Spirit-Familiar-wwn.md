You have a loyal and devoted companion in the form of a minor spirit, devil, construct, magical beast, or another type of creature. While its abilities are limited, it remains unwavering in its loyalty to you.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Select a form for your familiar that is no smaller than a cat nor larger than a human. It possesses the traits and abilities of an entity created by the Calculation of the Evoked Servitor on page 68. You can summon or dismiss it as a Main Action, causing it to appear within melee range of its owner. During its vanishment, it cannot carry objects with it except for the clothing natural to its shape. Your familiar has no need for food, water, or sleep. If it is killed, it vanishes and cannot be summoned again for 24 hours. Additionally, once per day, it can refresh one point of Committed Effort for you, help you in your endeavours.

2. It gains the ability to make attacks with a hit bonus equal to half your level, rounded up, dealing 1d8 damage on a successful hit without inflicting Shock.
3. It gains a +1 bonus to skill checks, which can be applied to a range of situations equivalent to a normal human background.
4. It gains an additional shape of your choice, which it can adopt or discard as an On Turn action.
5. It gains the ability to hover or fly at its usual movement rate.
6. It can freely communicate with others in any language that you know.
