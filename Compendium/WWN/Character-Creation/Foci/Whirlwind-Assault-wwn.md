---

You are an unstoppable force of carnage and devastation in melee combat, capable of cleaving through multiple lesser foes with ferocious intensity. However, to fully unleash your potential, you must overcome the perils of being surrounded.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Stab as a bonus skill, emphasising your proficiency in close-quarters combat. Once per scene, as an On Turn action, you can unleash a frenzy of devastating strikes, applying your Shock damage to all foes within melee range, provided they are susceptible to your Shock. This ability allows you to strike fear into your enemies and deal significant damage to multiple targets simultaneously.

- [ ] **Level 2**: The sheer brutality of your attacks is such that the first time you kill someone in a round with a normal attack, whether it's through the rolled damage on a hit or the Shock damage it inflicts, you instantly gain a second attack. This additional attack can be directed towards any target within range, allowing you to continue your onslaught without hesitation. You can utilise any weapon that is ready for use to execute this second attack, maximising your efficiency and unleashing devastation upon your foes.
