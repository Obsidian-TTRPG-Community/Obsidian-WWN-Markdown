title: Unarmed Combatant
---

Your unarmed combat prowess surpasses that of individuals wielding swords or other weapons. Your empty hands possess a deadly power, particularly when it comes to subduing opponents armed with bows or similar ranged long arms. It is important to note that at least one hand needs to be free to execute these techniques.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Punch as a bonus skill, enhancing your proficiency in unarmed combat. Your unarmed attacks become increasingly formidable as your Punch skill level increases. At level 0, they inflict 1d6 damage. At level 1, they deal 1d8 damage. At level 2, the damage increases to 1d10. Level 3 inflicts 1d12 damage, while level 4 delivers 1d12+1 damage. Starting from Punch-1 or higher, your unarmed attacks possess the Shock quality against targets with an Armor Class of 15 or less. However, when calculating the damage for this Shock effect, you do not add your Punch skill level twice. Instead, your Punch skill level determines the Shock damage against suitable targets.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Even when you miss with a Punch attack, you still manage to deal an unmodified `dice: 1d6|form` damage, as well as any potential Shock damage that the blow may inflict on the target. This ability showcases your unrivalled mastery of unarmed combat, ensuring that your strikes remain impactful and dangerous, regardless of the outcome.
