You possess exceptional social skills and have a talent for establishing valuable connections with others. You consistently find yourself acquainted with individuals who can help you in achieving your goals.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Gain Connect as a bonus skill. After spending at least a week in a location that is not openly hostile, you establish a network of contacts who are willing to help you with favours, within the bounds of minor illegality. You can request one favour per game day, and the extent to which your contacts will help is determined by the GM.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per game session, under reasonably plausible circumstances, you encounter an individual whom you know and who is willing to help you with minor favours. You have control over the timing and location of the encounter, but the GM determines the identity of the person and the extent of their capabilities in helping you.
