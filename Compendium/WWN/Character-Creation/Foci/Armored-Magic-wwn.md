> [!warning] Class Restrictions
> Requires [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Class/Mage-wwn|The Mage]] class, or an [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Class/Adventurer-wwn|Adventurer]] who has selected the [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Class/Adventurer-wwn#Partial Expert Partial Mage|Partial Expert/Partial Mage]] or [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Class/Adventurer-wwn#Partial Mage Partial Warrior|Partial Mage/Partial Warrior]] options.

Armoured Magic is usable only by magically inclined heroes who would be unable to cast spells or practice the magical arts while armoured. This focus reflects the training a hero has gone through to reduce the encumbrance of conventional armour.

- [ ] **Level 1**: While wearing armour with an Encumbrance value of two or less, you can seamlessly cast spells or utilise magical arts. Additionally, you can use a shield while casting, as long as your other hand remains empty for gesturing.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Regardless of the Encumbrance level of your armour, you possess the ability to cast spells while wearing it. Additionally, you have mastered the art of casting spells even when both of your hands are occupied, as long as they are not bound.
