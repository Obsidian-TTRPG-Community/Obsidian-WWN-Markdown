There is something about your hero that hinders the easy use of magic on them. This could be attributed to a potent birth blessing, an extraordinary supernatural bloodline, or even a fundamental occult incompatibility. 

- [ ] **Level 1**: You and all allies within a twenty-foot radius gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws against magical effects. As an On Turn action, you possess the ability to sense the presence or use of magic within a twenty-foot radius of yourself. However, you cannot discern specific details about the magic or its source. Furthermore, the first failed saving throw against a magical effect that you experience in a day is automatically turned into a success, benefiting from a stroke of natural resistance.
    
- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per day, utilising your innate abilities, you can instantly negate the impact of an unwanted magical effect or supernatural monstrous ability. This immunity applies even if the effect or ability would not typically allow a saving throw. Moreover, this immunity persists during the scene, offering you protection against persistent magical effects.
