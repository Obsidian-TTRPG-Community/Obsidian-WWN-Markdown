Your proficiency with thrown weapons and melee attacks is remarkably exceptional. However, it's important to note that this Focus does not enhance unarmed attacks or non-thrown projectile weapons. Furthermore, the bonuses provided by this Focus do not combine with those of [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Foci/Deadeye-wwn|Deadeye]] or any other Foci that add a skill's level to your damage or Shock.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You acquire Stab as an additional skill. With this skill, you can swiftly prepare a stored melee or thrown weapon as an Instant action. Additionally, when making an attack with a melee or thrown weapon, you can add your Stab skill level to its damage roll or Shock damage (if applicable).

- [ ] **Level 2**: When you unleash a melee attack, the Shock it inflicts on the target always assumes they have an Armor Class (AC) of 10, regardless of their actual AC. Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to hit with all thrown or melee attacks.
