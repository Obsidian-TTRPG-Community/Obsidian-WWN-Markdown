You possess extraordinary skills in presenting yourself as someone you are not, utilising disguises, voice mimicry, and swift wardrobe changes. Some impostors rely on the acting prowess of Perform, while others employ cunning techniques from the realm of Sneak.

- [ ]  Level 1: You gain Perform or Sneak as a bonus skill, depending on your preferred approach to deception. Once per scene, you have the ability to reroll any failed skill check or saving throw associated with maintaining an imposture or disguise. This allows you to rectify any mistakes or setbacks and increase the chances of maintaining your charade. Furthermore, you can create a false identity of relatively low social importance. You can flawlessly portray this person, making it extremely difficult to connect you to that identity unless presented with highly compelling evidence. You have the capability to change this false identity by dedicating a week's worth of effort in constructing a new one.
- [ ] 
- [ ] **Level 2**: You possess the remarkable ability to alter your clothing and armour effortlessly. With a single Main Action, you can switch between any of three pre-selected appearances. In addition to your original false identity, you have the capacity to establish a new false identity in each city or significant community where you spend at least a day. This enables you to adapt to various situations and environments, further enhancing your versatility in the art of deception.
