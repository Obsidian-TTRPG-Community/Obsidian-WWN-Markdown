You possess exceptional expertise in handling both mundane and magical traps and snares. Whether it's the perilous hazards found in the depths of dungeons or the intricate traps within the lairs of sorcerers, you possess uncommon knowledge in this field. Furthermore, you can improvise traps using materials readily available to you.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Notice as a bonus skill, further honing your abilities in detecting traps and snares. Once per a scene, you can reroll any failed saving throw or skill check related to traps or snares, allowing you to rectify any errors or missteps. With just five minutes of work, you can set up traps in portals, containers, passageways or other narrow spaces using foot snares, caltrops, toxic needles, or other hazards. Non-lethal traps cause the first victim to trigger them to lose a round of actions, while dangerous traps inflict 1d6 damage plus twice your character's level, with a corresponding saving throw for half damage. Please note that you can only maintain one such improvised trap at a time. The laying of more formidable traps may require favourable circumstances and the GM's approval.
    
- [ ] **Level 2**: Your knowledge encompasses the secrets of unraveling even magical traps or arcane hazards that would typically require a wizard to dispel them. Once per a scene, your efforts are akin to casting the Extirpate Arcana spell against a trap or hazard, functioning as if you were a Mage of twice your level. The relevant skill check for this ability can be either Intelligence/Notice or Dexterity/Notice. This capability can be utilised against any stationary magical effect that is susceptible to being dispelled by the **Extirpate Arcana** spell.
