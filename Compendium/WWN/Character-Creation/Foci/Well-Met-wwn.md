You possess an extraordinary ability to charm and pacify individuals and creatures you have just met. However, once they become acquainted with you, their opinions are more likely to be based on personal experiences, and the effect of this Focus is limited to a single encounter with a target.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Your mere presence has a positive impact on the reaction rolls made by those the party encounters. The reaction rolls receive a +1 bonus as long as you are present, regardless of whether you are the one doing the talking. This bonus applies even to initially hostile beings, who will typically allow a round for parley before resorting to immediate violence, unless they are ambushing or have a clear reason for instant aggression.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per game session, during a reaction roll, you can cause the subject to exhibit an exceptionally friendly and helpful disposition towards you and your party. The extent of their friendliness and assistance is determined by what is plausible within the context of the situation. The exact reason for this sudden favourability is left to the discretion of the Game Master. The creature may mistake your nature, find you amusing, or seek a favour from you and your allies.
