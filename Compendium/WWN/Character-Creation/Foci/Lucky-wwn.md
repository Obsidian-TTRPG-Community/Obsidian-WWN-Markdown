You possess an extraordinary reservoir of remarkable luck that has saved your life at least once in the past and continues to provide you with an advantage in seemingly hopeless situations. However, this luck does not favour those who are already fortunate, as this Focus can only be chosen by a player character with at least one attribute modifier of -1 or less.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Once per a week, when faced with a blow or effect that would have otherwise resulted in your demise, mortal wounds, or rendered you helpless, fate intervenes in your favor. The blow or effect somehow fails to connect or affect you, granting you a miraculous escape from certain doom. Additionally, when making rolls related to games of chance, you roll twice and take the better result, allowing your innate luck to shine through.
    
- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per a session, in a situation of great need or peril, you can rely on your exceptional luck and roll a single six-sided die (1d6). If you roll a 2 or higher, fortune smiles upon you, and something fortunate happens to further your goals, provide an escape from immediate danger, or grant you the advantage you require, though not necessarily guaranteeing immediate victory. However, if you roll a 1, the situation will take an abrupt turn for the worse, as determined by the Game Master, presenting you with unexpected complications.
