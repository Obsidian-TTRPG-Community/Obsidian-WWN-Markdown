You possess an extraordinary knack for detecting traders and uncovering favorable deals, whether they are legal or not. Even individuals who are typically reluctant to negotiate can be persuaded to engage in discussions if you possess something they desire.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain the Trade skill as a bonus. With just thirty minutes of effort, you can locate a buyer or seller within the community for any tradable good or service, regardless of its legality. However, procuring rare or difficult-to-obtain items or services, such as hiring an assassin to target a king or seeking a specific ancient artefact, may require embarking on an adventure, subject to the Game Master's discretion.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per a session, you can approach a sentient being who is not currently engaged in hostile actions towards you or your allies and make a request that it can comprehend. If the request appears feasible, the sentient being will entertain the possibility of fulfilling it in exchange for a price or favour it believes you are capable of providing. However, substantial favours may come at a high cost.
