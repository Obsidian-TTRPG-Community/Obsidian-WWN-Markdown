You possess exceptional craftsmanship abilities and have a knack for improvisation, even outside your usual area of expertise. You can create mods for equipment, even without being an Expert, after the rules outlined on page 56.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Craft as a bonus skill. Your Craft skill is considered one level higher, up to a maximum of 5, when it comes to crafting and maintaining mods. Additionally, the mods you build require one fewer unit of arcane salvage, with a minimum of one. Your Craft skill is also applicable to any regular crafting profession's work, allowing you to create their items without any penalties.

- [ ] **Level 2**: The first mod you add to an item has no maintenance requirements and costs only half the usual silver piece cost. This benefit applies beside the benefits of installing a mod in masterwork gear that you build. You have an automatic success when attempting to build masterwork gear. Once per month, you can reduce the salvage cost of a created mod by an additional unit, with a minimum cost of zero.
