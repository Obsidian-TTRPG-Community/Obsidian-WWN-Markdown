title: Shocking Assault
---

You possess a fearsome presence in close combat, instilling stress and distraction in your enemies even when your strikes do not draw blood. Your melee attacks carry an inherent ferocity that unsettles your foes.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Punch or Stab as a bonus skill, augmenting your prowess in melee combat. The Shock damage inflicted by your weapon treats all targets as if they had an Armor Class of 10. This assumption holds true if your weapon is capable of causing harm to the target, and the target is not immune to Shock damage. This feature ensures that your attacks can affect and disorient your opponents, even if they possess some level of physical defence.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Building upon your inherent menace, you gain a +2 bonus to the Shock damage rating of all melee weapons and unarmed attacks that inflict Shock damage. Furthermore, the regular hits you deliver never cause less damage than the amount of Shock damage inflicted, even on a miss. This enhancement to your offensive capabilities reinforces the potency of your attacks and emphasises the consistent threat you pose in melee combat.
