You have honed your skills in executing swift and deadly attacks, gaining specific advantages when carrying out an Execution Attack, as explained in the rules on page 44.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Gain Sneak as a bonus skill. You have the ability to discreetly hide a small object, such as a knife, from casual inspection. You can swiftly retrieve this concealed object as an On Turn action. Furthermore, when making point-blank thrown or melee attacks with the concealed object during a surprise round, you have a guaranteed hit against your target.

- [ ] **Level 2**: You have the ability to swiftly move towards your target while executing a deadly attack. When performing an Execution Attack, you can take a Move action in the same round, allowing you to close the distance rapidly before launching your attack. You can split this Move action, using part of it before the attack and the remainder after. This swift movement is done so seamlessly that it doesn't alert the victim or impede by any intervening bodyguards.
