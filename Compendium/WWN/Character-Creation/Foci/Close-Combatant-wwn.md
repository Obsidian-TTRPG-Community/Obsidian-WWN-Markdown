You've had plenty of opportunity to get better at close-in fighting and acrobatics with drawn weapons. You are very skilled at escaping melee combat uninjured.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Gain Close Combat as a bonus skill. You can engage in melee combat with knife-sized thrown weapons without suffering penalties for being in proximity to attackers. You can ignore Shock damage from melee assaults, even when unarmored, but using this ability disrupts any spellcasting you attempt during the same round as you focus on evasive manoeuvres.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Gain Close Combat as a bonus skill. Your melee attacks inflict Shock damage as if the target's Armor Class were 10. You are skilled at executing a Fighting Withdrawal, treating it as an On Turn action that can be performed without restriction.
