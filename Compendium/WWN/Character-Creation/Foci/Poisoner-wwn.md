You possess a high level of expertise in the art of poisoning, and can craft potent toxins from the readily available flora and minerals. It takes you an hour to brew a poison, and you can maintain a stock of fresh doses equal to your character's level. When using blade venom's, applying them requires a Main Action, and their effects last for ten minutes or until a successful hit or Shock is inflicted, whichever comes first. The detection of poisoned food can be accomplished through a Wisdom/Notice skill check, with a difficulty of 10 or 12 if the diner is not a noble or naturally vigilant against poison. Each dose of poison can affect up to six individuals.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Heal as a bonus skill, expanding your knowledge and proficiency in the realm of poison. Additionally, you can reroll any failed saving throw against poison, showcasing your resilience and resistance to toxic substances. Your toxins, when successfully applied, inflict 2d6 damage plus your character's level on a hit or Shock. A Physical saving throw can be made to reduce the damage by half. Furthermore, your incapacitating or hallucinogenic toxins follow the same damage pattern. However, when an individual is reduced to zero hit points by these toxins, they are simply incapacitated for an hour rather than being killed.

- [ ] **Level 2**: You have developed immunity to poison, rendering you impervious to its effects. Additionally, you can administer a universal antidote to any poisoned ally as a Main Action, providing swift relief from toxic substances. Any attempts made to detect or resist your poisons incur a penalty equal to your Heal skill level, showcasing the potency and expertise of your craft. Furthermore, your ingested poisons are considered Execution Attacks against unsuspecting targets, as described on page 44, resulting in a penalty to the target's Physical saving throw equal to your Heal skill level. They also inflict 1d6 damage per level on a successful saving throw. It's important to note that these ingested poisons can be non-lethal, as per your discretion.
