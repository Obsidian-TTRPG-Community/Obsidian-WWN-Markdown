Gain Persuade as a bonus skill. You possess a remarkable charisma that naturally influences others and compels them to follow your lead. At level 1, this is attributed to your charm and personal magnetism, while at level 2, it may indicate latent magical abilities or an ancient sorcerer lineage. When this Focus mentions followers, it refers to non-player characters (NPCs) who willingly serve and support you. Note that player characters (PCs) do not count as followers.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Gain Lead as a bonus skill. Once per day, you possess the ability to make a request from a non-hostile NPC. To do so, make a skill check using your Charisma and Lead skills. The difficulty of the check is based on the NPC's Morale score. If you succeed, the NPC will follow your request, as long as it is not significantly harmful or goes against their nature.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Those who choose to follow you are filled with unwavering confidence. Any NPC under your direct leadership receives a bonus to their Morale score, hit rolls, and [[Compendium/WWN/The-Rules-of-the-Game/Skill Checks/Skill Checks|skill checks]], equal to your Lead skill level. Additionally, your followers and henchmen will remain loyal and will not act against your interests, unless they are under extreme duress.
