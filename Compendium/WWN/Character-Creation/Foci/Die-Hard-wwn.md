You possess remarkable resilience and can withstand injuries and endure hardships that would incapacitate others.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You have an additional 2 maximum hit points per level, providing you with increased durability. If you are Mortally Wounded, you automatically stabilise as long as you have not suffered severe bodily damage.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per day, when you are brought down to zero hit points by an injury, you miraculously survive with one hit point remaining. However, this ability cannot protect you from instant and overwhelmingly lethal damage.
