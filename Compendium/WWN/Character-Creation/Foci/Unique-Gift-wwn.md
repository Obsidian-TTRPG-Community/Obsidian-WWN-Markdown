Your hero possesses an extraordinary ability or magical knack that defies categorisation within the existing Focus options. This choice serves as a catch-all for representing a special power that holds enough significance to warrant a Focus selection. The exact nature and effect of this ability should be determined collaboratively between the player and the Game Master. Together, they should work out a result that feels fair, reasonable, and fitting for the campaign.

The specific impact of this unique gift will vary from table to table and campaign to campaign. Its value and relevance depend on the setting and context in which it is used. For example, the ability to breathe underwater may serve as a mere novelty in a desert setting, but it could hold immense significance in a campaign centred around piracy in an expansive archipelago. The player and GM should consider the potential implications and adapt the ability accordingly.

As with any special power, it is essential for the group to remain open to revisiting and reevaluating the gift if it proves to be significantly weaker or stronger in the actual gameplay than anticipated. Balancing and adjusting the ability ensures an enjoyable and harmonious experience for all players involved.
