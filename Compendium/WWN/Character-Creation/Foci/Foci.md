After determining your hero's class, you can choose their Foci, special abilities or talents that your hero has developed. Each Focus typically has two levels, with the first level acquired upon selection, and the second level gained when chosen again. Once a Focus has reached its maximum level, it cannot be chosen again. Some Foci can be taken multiple times to apply to different skills.

Many Foci provide a bonus skill, get at level-0 if you don't already have it, or at level-1 if you already have it at level-0. If you already have the skill at level-1, you can choose any other skill except Magic. If you acquire a Focus after reaching first level, the skill associated with it is improved instead, as explained on page 11.

Every character can select one free Focus representing their experiences or natural talents, which doesn't have to be directly related to their class. For example, a Mage could possess the Close Combatant Focus, indicating proficiency in knife fighting, or a Warrior might have a focus on being exceptionally Cultured.

Additionally, a Warrior or Partial Warrior can choose one Focus related to their martial background, while an Expert or Partial Expert can select a Focus related to a non-combat aspect. The GM determines if a chosen Focus truly aligns with the character's class, and some Foci may be applicable to both classes.
