You possess an extraordinary talent for rescuing allies who are mortally wounded and expediting the recovery of those under your care.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Heal as a bonus skill, allowing you to excel in the art of healing. As an On Turn action, you can attempt to stabilise one adjacent person who is mortally wounded every round. When making Heal skill checks, you roll 3d6 and discard the lowest die, increasing your chances of success. Additionally, when providing first aid after a battle, you heal twice the normal amount of hit points, as described on page 48.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Your curative abilities possess a magical essence. You can use a Main Action to heal an adjacent wounded ally, mending 1d6 plus your Heal skill level in damage. This potent healing has the potential to revive the individual without leaving any lingering frailty. However, each instance of this healing application adds 1 System Strain to the target. It's important to note that this gift cannot be used on targets who have already reached their maximum System Strain.
