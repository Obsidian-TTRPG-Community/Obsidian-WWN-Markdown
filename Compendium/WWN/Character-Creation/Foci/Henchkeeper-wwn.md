You possess a unique talent for recruiting and commanding lost souls who willingly serve you. Through promises of various rewards such as wealth, power, excitement, or even personal desires, you are able to entice individuals to become your loyal henchmen. These henchmen will remain devoted to you unless they experience clear betrayal or are placed in unacceptable danger. 

Typically, these henchmen come from the fringes of society, including outcasts, the desperate, or those with limited options. While you can use traditional means like payment or inducements to acquire additional henchmen, their loyalty and competence will be directly proportional to the treatment and compensation you provide.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Lead as a bonus skill, allowing you to effectively guide and manage your henchmen. Upon arriving in a community, you can acquire suitable henchmen within 24 hours, assuming there are potential candidates available. These henchmen, although reluctant to engage in combat unless their lives are at stake, will accompany you on adventures and willingly face great danger to help you. Henchmen from civilised societies are treated as Peaceful Humans based on the bestiary section. The amount of henchmen you can have at a given time is determined by your character level divided by three (rounded up). You can release henchmen without any ill will at any plausible time and can later re-enlist them if you find yourself without a current henchman.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Your henchmen exhibit exceptional loyalty and determination, willingly fighting for you unless the odds are overwhelmingly against them. Whether due to their innate skills or their unwavering devotion to you, they are treated as Veteran Soldiers based on the bestiary section. It is possible to cultivate devoted henchmen from skilled and highly capable NPCs, but this requires you to have done them significant favours or provided substantial assistance, earning their fierce loyalty.
