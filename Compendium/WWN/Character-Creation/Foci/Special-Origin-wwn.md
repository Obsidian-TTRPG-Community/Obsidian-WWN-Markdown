In Worlds Without Number, the assumption is that player characters (PCs) are human or closely resemble humans with no significant differences. However, for players who wish to belong to more exotic species or demihuman kinds, they can select an appropriate origin Focus aligned with their chosen species. These special origins are provided in the bestiary chapter, featuring various types of creatures.

The availability of these special origins will ultimately depend on the campaign and the Game Master's permission. Even if elves and dwarves, for example, exist within the campaign world, the GM is not obligated to allow players to use them as PCs if their inclusion does not align with the intended tone or location of the game. It is important to have open communication with the GM and respect their decisions regarding character options.

It is worth noting that if a player desires to be different without seeking any specific mechanical benefits, they do not need to purchase a special Focus. If their chosen demihuman or alien nature does not grant any substantial advantages over a human character, they can simply proclaim their unique nature, assuming the GM permits such beings in their campaign setting.
