You are vigilant of your environment and can rarely be taken by surprise.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Gain Notice as a bonus skill. You cannot be surprised, and opponents cannot use the Execution Attack option against you. If the GM determines initiative by sides, you can add a +1 bonus to your side's initiative roll. However, if multiple Alert characters are present, this bonus does not stack. If initiative is rolled individually, you have the advantage of rolling twice and selecting the better result.

- [ ] **Level 2**: You have first initiative in a combat round unless someone else also has Alert Level 2.
