You bear both the blessings and curses of the Outsiders, granting you the ability to survive in alien environments that are inhospitable to ordinary humans. The origin of this ability may stem from ancient modifications made to your lineage, making you a superior servant, or you might be a unique hybrid of alien and human ancestry. Those burdened with this heritage often possess notable physical variations from human norms, often disguising themselves as unconventional demihumans or unfortunate human mutants.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Choose one set of benefits from the options below, reflecting the unique traits bestowed upon you by your alien heritage. It's worth noting that additional gifts may exist, subject to GM approval.

1. **Immunity to Heat**: You become immune to heat damage and can effortlessly breathe and see through smoke, allowing you to navigate these challenging environments without a hindrance.
2. **Water Adaptation**: You possess an inherent affinity for water, enabling you to breathe underwater and see through it up to a distance of 120 feet (36.58 m), regardless of lighting conditions. Additionally, your swimming speed is twice as fast as that of a typical human.
3. **Gravity Modification**: Your physical composition is attuned to either heavier or lighter gravity conditions. You gain a +1 bonus to either your Strength or Dexterity modifier, up to a maximum of +3, and a corresponding -1 penalty to the modifier of the other attribute.
4. **Radiant Sustenance**: Your nourishment stems from invisible radiations, freeing you from the need to eat, sleep, or breathe. Furthermore, you possess exceptional vision, allowing you to see clearly even in complete darkness.
