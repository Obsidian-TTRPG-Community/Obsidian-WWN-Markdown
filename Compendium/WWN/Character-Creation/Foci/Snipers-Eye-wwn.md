You possess unparalleled expertise in striking unsuspecting targets with thrown knives or arrows. These specialised benefits apply specifically when executing a precise attack with a bow, hurlant, or thrown weapon, as outlined on page 44.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Shoot as a bonus skill, enhancing your proficiency in ranged combat. When making a skill check for a ranged Execution Attack or target shooting, you roll 3d6 and discard the lowest die. This feature increases your chances of achieving deadly accuracy, allowing you to hone in on your target with exceptional precision.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Your aim is unerring when it comes to ranged Execution Attacks. You no longer miss your mark, ensuring that your attacks find their intended target. Furthermore, when a target is hit by one of your ranged Execution Attacks, they suffer a -4 penalty on the Physical saving throw to avoid immediate mortal injury. Even if the saving throw is successful, the target still takes double the normal damage inflicted by the attack. This amplified damage serves as a testament to your skill and ensures devastating consequences for those who fall victim to your precise strikes.
