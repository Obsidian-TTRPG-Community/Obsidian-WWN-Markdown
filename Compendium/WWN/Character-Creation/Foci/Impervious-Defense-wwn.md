title: Impervious Defense
---

Through a combination of extraordinary reflexes, exceptional luck, supernatural lineage, or magical abilities, you possess an innate and formidable defense comparable to high-quality armor. However, the benefits of this Focus do not stack with actual armour, although modifiers from Dexterity or shields still apply.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You possess an inherent Armor Class of 15 plus half of your character level, rounded up. This innate defence grants you an added layer of protection against attacks and increases your overall resilience.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per day, utilising your innate abilities, you can instantly shrug off a single weapon attack or physical trauma inflicted by an adversary. This defensive manoeuvre allows you to resist the harm or damage inflicted. It is important to note that this ability does not apply to environmental damage, falling damage, or any other type of harm that cannot be effectively prevented by conventional armour.
