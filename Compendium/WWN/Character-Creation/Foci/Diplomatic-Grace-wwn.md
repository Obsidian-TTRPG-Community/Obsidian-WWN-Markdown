Your ability to engage in personal negotiations is extraordinary and seemingly supernatural. It surpasses the ordinary realm of skills and appears almost mystical.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Convince as a bonus skill, enabling you to excel in persuasive communication. Moreover, you possess the ability to speak all the languages commonly used in your region, and you can learn new languages to a functional level within a week, achieving fluency within a month. Additionally, when making skill check dice rolls related to negotiation or diplomacy, you can reroll any 1s, increasing your chances of success.

- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per day, you have the power to silently consecrate a bargain. When a deal is consecrated, the target must succeed in a Mental save to break the agreement, unless their own life or something they hold dear is directly threatened by it. Usually, NPCs will not even attempt to violate the consecrated deal. It's important to note that the agreement must be specific and time-limited, rather than an open-ended arrangement.
