---

You embody the role of a bodyguard, shieldbearer, or a gifted defender dedicated to safeguarding others in the chaos of battle and dire confrontations. Your exceptional ability lies in shielding your allies from the attacks of those who seek to harm them.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Stab or Punch as a bonus skill, emphasising your proficiency in close combat. Additionally, you receive a +2 bonus on all skill checks for the Screen Ally combat action. Your expertise allows you to screen against one more attacker per round than your skill would typically allow. Furthermore, once per round, you can utilise the Screen Ally action to defend against intangible spells, magical attacks, or shield allies from area-effect explosions or magic. To succeed in such attempts, the usual opposing skill check is required, with the assailant using their Magic skill.

- [ ] **Level 2**: The first Screen Ally skill check you make in a round is automatically successful, showcasing your unwavering skill and dedication as a protector. Additionally, while actively screening someone, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class (AC), bolstering your defences further. Your remarkable abilities extend to screening against adversaries as formidable as ogres or oxen, demonstrating your capability to shield allies from a wide range of threats.
