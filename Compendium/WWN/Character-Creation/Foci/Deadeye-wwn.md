Your proficiency lies in using ranged weapons. Although this skill is usually associated with bows, it also extends to thrown weapons or any other ranged weapon that requires the Shoot skill. However, when using thrown weapons, you cannot simultaneously benefit from both the [[Compendium/WWN/Character-Creation/Foci/Armsmaster-wwn|Armsmaster]] Focus and Deadeye.

- [ ] **Level 1**: Get the Shoot skill as a bonus, granting you proficiency in ranged combat. As an Instant action, you can swiftly prepare a stowed ranged weapon for use. Despite an enemy being in proximity, you can wield a bow, or a two-handed ranged weapon, although it incurs a -4 hit penalty. Additionally, you can enhance the damage dealt by a ranged weapon by adding your Shoot skill level to the damage roll.

- [ ] **Level 2**: You can reload crossbows or similarly slow-loading weapons as an action during your turn, as long as the reloading process can be completed within a single round. You can wield ranged weapons of any size in close combat without suffering any penalties. Once per scene, during your turn, if you are targeting an inanimate, non-creature object, you will automatically hit unless you roll a 2 on your Shoot skill check or the shot is physically impossible to achieve.
