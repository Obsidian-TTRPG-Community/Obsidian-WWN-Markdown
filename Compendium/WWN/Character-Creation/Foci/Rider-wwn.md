While anyone with any level of Ride skill can exhibit competence in fighting on horseback or tending to their mount's well-being, your connection with your steeds reaches almost supernatural levels. You possess an extraordinary bond with your horses, allowing you to push them beyond their normal limits.

- [ ] **Level 1**: You gain Ride as a bonus skill, enhancing your proficiency in equestrian activities. Your steeds benefit from a Morale score of 12 in battle, reflecting their unwavering loyalty and determination. Additionally, if your Armor Class is higher than that of your mount, they will utilize your higher value for their defense. Furthermore, your steeds can travel 50% further in a day than is typical for their kind, displaying exceptional endurance. You have the innate ability to intuitively communicate with riding beasts, extracting as much information from them as their level of intellect allows.
    
- [ ] **Level 2**: Once per a scene, you have the power to negate a successful attack against your steed, employing an Instant action to protect them. This quick reaction can prevent harm from befalling your loyal companion. Additionally, once per a scene, you can reroll any failed Ride skill check, ensuring a higher chance of success in equestrian tasks. Through a telepathic connection, you can send and receive simple warnings, thoughts, and commands to and from your steed as long as they are within a range of two hundred feet. This bond can be established with one steed at a time, requiring an hour of dedicated bonding to form a deep connection.
