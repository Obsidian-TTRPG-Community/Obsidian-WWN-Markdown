## Overview

> [!INFO]
> The goal of an exploration challenge is to engage the players in the setting and make them think carefully about how to navigate it and its mysteries.

These challenges seek to enable the PCs to search through a wilderness for points of interest or spelunk through the tunnels of a [[Deep]]. Some of these sites may be frequented by hostile creatures while others may have potentially noteworthy objects or devices operable by puzzle-solving.

These challenges ought to be populated with plenty of things to interact with, take, investigate, fight with, or run away from. There's an example below, but this is not the only way to do it. Let your imagination run wild.

This creates an abstract map that is more focused on the points of interest than the large amounts of space between them. Those large amounts of spaces will hold no detrimental, beneficial, or interesting opportunity for the group. This is so as to dissuade the party from feeling the urge to carefully map out and navigate every minute detail in an underground cavern or forest.

For those interested in the classic graph-paper dungeon-crawls, find some advice below in converting the abstract maps into more detailed plans.

### Determing the Site Type

1. Structure
   - A [[Deep]]
   - A Haunted Castle
   - Sand-choked passages of a buried city
   - Randomize with results from [[page 238]]
2. Wilderness Exploration
   - Focus efforts on a single session's worth of coverable terrain
     - 12x12 hex zone with six-mile hexes should be plenty
     - This type of zone considers PCs will be searching this region carefully as opposed to navigating directly through it as quickly as possible
   - Populate the wilderness with interesting ruins, lairs, hamlets, and [[page 242|other points of interest]]

Use the type of structure, dungeon, or wilderness to be the driving inspiration for what creatures might inhabit or be attracted to these locations. This will then further enable you to designate what locations will be found inside, what kind of odd devices will exist therein, or what other types of strange workings might be ensuring there.

### Choose Inhabitant Framework

Structure-based sites may be empty of all kinds of inhabitants, though most dungeons will have something lurking about. Determine what is in a given space will prove useful in flavoring and influencing your later decisions.

The table on [[page 240]] will help create an outline for what inhabitant framework may be present. Perhaps it's a single, controlling group that has claimed the area, or it may be that there are several groups with differing relations between them all. It may be that the place was, at one time, inhabited by unintelligent creatures that were driven out by the current, sentient occupants.

To add additional layers, leverage the [[What happened to their predecessors?]] table in multiple iterations, rerolling for each period to evolve the location's history.

To adapt these tables to wilderness exploration, use the same inhabitant table and modify the context such that it applies to tribes, clans, unmarked or hidden villages, refugee encampments, or other population nuclei that exist in this uncharted zone. Additionally, account for locations you've already established as existing in this region, whether that's a particular village or outpost.
