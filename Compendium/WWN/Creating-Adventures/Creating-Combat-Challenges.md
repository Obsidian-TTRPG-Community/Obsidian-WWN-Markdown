## Overview

> [!CAUTION]
> **There are almost no circumstances in which you should force the PCs to engage directly in a combat challenge**

Combat challenges are generated from tenuous scenarios where a fight is the probable resolution. It may come from the player characters desiring to knock off some antagonist, or they've found themselves face-to-face with a creature who's fight, not flight, response kicked in, or you're simply well-enough acquainted with your party to know that they won't let a certain NPC walk away with their terrible characteristics.

Take caution to not force combat challenges. PCs are often resourceful enough to dodge combat; if there's a will, there's a way. Some particularly charismatic groups may find a way to force their peaceful solution on the challenge. It's often in the PCs best interest to avoid combat if it isn't absolutely necessary; as the GM try not force your party into unavoidable combat encounters. Combat is appropriate when the PCs have elected to slay a dragon, but it is not appropriate if the party decides they're just after the dragon's gold and you decide to orchestrate things such that the only way to steal the dragon's hoard is to destroy it in battle.

The purpose of this section in creating a combat challenge is to arm the GM with all the facts needed to run the encounter. For lesser challenges, like determining the disposition of an [[Anak]] with a treat who happens to be lurking nearby, you may only need a brief line detailing its combat statistics. Greater challenges, like trying to kill a cult leader, you may need something more substantive.

### The Essentials

The first step in fleshing out a combat challenge is to map out a list of the associated creatures and NPCs. Once you have determined who's present, generate or note their combat statistics. Consider the following list:

1. Think about the target
2. Think about any surrounding threats, associates, or minions that it might have
    - Merchants have guards, cult leaders have underling fanatics, and Anak warriors often roam with their warbands
    - Allied groups may have individuals in the area
    - The target may have employed or forced others into accomplishing their aims
    - Populating a [[Deep]] or some other highly-populated location of monsters, the creatures likely belong in that environment, or have adapted to live in the area
3. Avoid thinking about "balancing" combat challenges
    - Don't adjust enemy numbers to make the encounter easier or harder based on the power level of the party; rather, tell the narrative in a logical and coherent way such that the PCs can engage with it
    - i.e. The King's Guard are ferocious, the Anak tribe has scores of combat-capable warriors, the evil sorcerer is surrounding by their inhuman minions, and the most infamously dangerous swordsman in the country regardless of whether your party is level one or level ten
4. Think about the context of your adventure's purpose
   - A [[Deep]] for novice heroes should contain winnable combat challenges
   - There should be a logical reason for why the [[Deep]] is filled with PC-slaughtering hell-beasts
   - Have trivial and grand foes
   - Refer to [[page 295]] for aid in assessing a combat challenge's likelihood of killing PCs

### The Combat Setting

Now that you have the "who", it's time to focus on the "where" the conflict might happen. This will help you think about what kind of information you need to properly establish the encounter. Here are some examples:

- A merchant's house may require a map of the grounds
- An evil priest lurking in a [[Deep]] will require details about the subterranean passages
- A murder in the middle of a high-traffic street will instigate public outcry

Again, think about the context of your adventurer's purpose as you generate this location, as it is a **temptation** to turn these challenges into set-piece battles, with dozens of pre-defined environmental flavor to enable tactical play. While pressure plates, steep cliffs, howling winds, acid pits, and other such decorations are exciting and interesting, most people do not frequent places where a terrible death is a misstep away. Keep in mind the resourcefulness of your heroes; they may not be willing to engage their enemy on their enemy's terms, but rather attempt to coax them into ambushes of the party's own making.

With that said, *personalizing* a combat challenge with environment-specific details, perils, and nuances is advised. PCs attempting to kill a duke should not be surprised when they are quickly surrounded by the duke's retainers and guardsmen. Combats taking place in a forest of frozen alien glass that is prone to blizzards will likely involve terrible winds, shredding bits of glass, and deadly collateral damage. *If* the environment in which the challenge takes place contains such qualities, jot down their effects.

### Establish Alternate Routes

Think about how your PCs could approach this challenge without a combat-first mentality.

- **There are almost no circumstances in which you should force the PCs to engage directly in a combat challenge**
- Adventures containing irrelevant but unavoidable fights will be hard on the party; it is, effectively, railroading that will result in dead characters
- Use morale checks, reaction rolls, and common-sense (with creatures not treating their potential death whimsically) when building combat challenges
- Consider leveraging social or minor exploration challenges to provide viable alternatives to initiative rolls; these might come in the form of convincing an enemy to back off or providing a secret back door to avoid combat entirely

### Death has Consequences

With the antagonist slain, it's time to consider the consequences. If they were someone's pawn, that someone will refill the position. Perhaps they will even seek to avenge their pawn's death. If the antagonist had their own minions, those folks will likely seek another leader. Those closely related to the slain antagonist will likely be angry at the killers, or enemies may be filled with gratitude.

Everyone serves some purpose in the world, even if it's as low as harassing merchant trains or bullying their inferiors. Now that they've been removed, that purpose vanishes or is filled by someone or something new. Perhaps the death of a bandit leader results in renewed trade between towns, but now the local lords are employing grievous taxes on their new source of income. The players may not always be aware of these consequences, but it benefits the GM to be mindful of them.
