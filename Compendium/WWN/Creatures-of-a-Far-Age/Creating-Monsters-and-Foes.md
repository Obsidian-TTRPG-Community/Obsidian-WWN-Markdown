title: Creating Monsters and Foes
---

When creating monsters or assigning statistics to human foes, the first step is to determine the role they will play in the world. Consider whether you need a terrifying hell-beast or just the stat line for an ordinary village guardsman.

In a sandbox campaign, monsters and enemies are not scaled based on the party's level. A creature's ferocity and abilities are determined by its place in the world, not the party's power level. A village guardsman may have only one hit die, while a monstrous hell-beast could have eight or nine.

The provided table of example stat lines offers baselines for various creatures and people. These are not universal truths, but rather starting points that can be modified to fit specific needs.

It's important to remember that putting a guaranteed party-slaughterer in the campaign is possible, but precautions should be taken to ensure the PCs have options other than direct combat. They should have forewarnings, opportunities to flee, negotiate, or hide from such dangerous foes.

The table includes several columns with different statistics for the creature:

- **Hit dice**: Determines the creature's power and hit points. Each hit die corresponds to 1d8 hit points.
- **AC**: Represents the creature's Armor Class, indicating how difficult it is to harm them. The higher the number, the tougher the creature. Humans usually have AC based on the armor they wear.
- Atk: The creature's total attack bonus for hit rolls in combat. It's usually equal to the hit dice, with possible bonuses for training, viciousness, or supernatural power. Some creatures have multiple attacks.
- **Dmg**: The damage inflicted by a successful hit. If "Wpn" is listed, it means the creature uses a specific weapon for damage calculation. Shock damage may also apply.
- **Shock**: Represents the Shock damage inflicted by the creature and the maximum AC it affects. For example, "3/13" means it inflicts a minimum of 3 Shock damage on a miss against a foe with AC 13 or less.
- **Move**: The creature's movement speed in a single Move action. It may vary depending on the creature's nature.
- **ML**: The creature's Morale score. If a Morale check is forced, the creature rolls 2d6. If the total is greater than its Morale score, it retreats or takes actions to disengage from the fight.
- **Inst**: The creature's Instinct score. When confused or provoked, it may behave according to its instincts rather than strategic decisions.
- **Skill**: The creature's Skill bonus for relevant skill checks. It represents their proficiency in certain abilities or talents.
- **Save**: The saving throw target used by the creature when making Physical, Mental, Evasion, or Luck saving throws. It's typically 15 minus half the creature's hit dice, rounded down.
